# golly-save-image
I updated this plugin. The PIL originally used by this plugin only supports python2.7. Golly now uses a version above python3.0, so I updated the database used by this plugin to Pillow

#Pre-work before use
1. You need to download python first, the version must be above 3.0
2. Install Pillow
Enter the following string of commands in your terminal
```
pip install Install Pillow
```
3.There are only two steps, congratulations you have completed!
